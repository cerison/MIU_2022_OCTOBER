1. Collectors.joining
2. Collectors.SummarizingInt - SummaryStatistics, min, max,count, sum and average
3. Different filters for each criteria - Problem Requirement
4. Use Primitive IntStream iterate and limit with your logic to generate squares
5. limit and skip

"aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd", "eee", "fff", "ggg", "hhh", "iii"
 0       1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8            
streamSection(nextStream(), 0, 3)
output: aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd

streamSection(nextStream(), 2, 5)
ccc, ddd, eee, fff

6. Reduce,also can try with flatmap how works
7. a)Startup code given, inside main class perform the task A. 
   Need to add a method getfullname() returns firstname + last name 

   b) Identity the inputs of the problem (a), 
      Convert into the Suitable Functional Interface.
      Create a Lambda implementation of Fucntional interface and
      decalred as public static final inside Lambda Library class. 
      Whenever needed call from the Lambda libary class.
      
8)  Perform the queries given in the PuttingIntoPractice class.
      Refer : streamandoperations package
9) Perform the queies given in the problem for the Dish class. 
      Refer : streamandoperations package
10) Perfomm the queries in ConstructorReference class

In your exam questions are similar like Problem 7, 8,9 & 10 to solve the queries
